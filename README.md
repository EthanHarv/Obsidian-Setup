# Obsidian Setup

This is my default setup for obsidian.

`Default_Setup/` is the actual folder, but for ease-of-downloading (and because git doesn't like showing empty folders) there's also:

- `Default_Setup.zip`—Contains all setup, meta content, folder structure, etc.
- `Default_Setup-Empty.zip`—Contains only setup.
