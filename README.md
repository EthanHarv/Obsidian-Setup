# Obsidian Setup

This is my default setup for obsidian.

`Default_Setup/` is the actual folder, but for ease-of-downloading there's also:

- `Default_Setup.zip`—Contains all setup, meta content, and folder structure.
- `Default_Setup-NoMeta.zip`—Contains only setup and folder structure.
- `Default_Setup-Empty.zip`—Contains only setup.
