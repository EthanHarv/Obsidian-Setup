# Tricks, Keybinds, and extras.

## Important-to-know^[And become *very* familiar with!] items

### Command Palette
- Opens with `Ctrl+P`
- Easily-searchable way to find *any* obsidian command.
- I use this all the time for [[Daily Notes]]

### Templater

- Opens with `Alt+E`
- Try making template names distinct enough to where you only have to type 2-3 letters before you can press enter and insert

### Quick Switcher

- Opens with `Ctrl+O`

### Lists

- You can press `Ctrl+Enter` once to create this type of bullet
- [ ] Twice for one of these
- [x] Three times to check it off
- [ ] Any more times toggles checked on/off

### Closing Panels, Going Back

- You can close the current main panel with `Ctrl+W`
- You can go back a page with `Ctrl+Alt+LEFTARROW` (`RIGHTARROW` goes forwards again) 

### Other Misc Keybinds (Custom)

- Emoji Picker: `Mod+J` (mod is `ctrl`/`cmd`)
- Excalidraw:
    - Open a new document in the current pane, and embed it into the current note: `Mod+Alt+Shift+E`
        - (Also useful to remember `Ctrl+Alt+LEFTARROW` here, to get back to your note)
    - Insert latex symbol (into drawing): `Mod+L`
- Templater: Jump to next cursor location: `Alt+Shift+E`
