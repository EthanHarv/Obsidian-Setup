# Themes and Custom CSS

If it's pleasing to look at, you're probably more likely to actually use it.

All settings can be found in `Settings > Appearence`

Take a look at the [[Theme Testing Page]] to see what you like and don't like!

## Theme

I use the Hipstersmoothie theme. 
I also enable translucent window, but that's mainly because it complements my background. YMMV.

## Custom CSS

I have three CSS snippets that I've made, `h-colors`, `prettier-lists`, and `oz-noselect`.

`h-colors` makes headings different colors, and `prettier-lists` affects both the actual lists as well as the left-hand-side file browser. You can make edits to them in `Settings > Appearence > CSS snippets` (open containing folder), and check out your changes on the [[Theme Testing Page|testing page]]

`oz-noselect` just makes [[Plugins#^7252bc|Ozan's Image in Editor]] `<img>` tags undraggable.
