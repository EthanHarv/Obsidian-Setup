# Themes and Custom CSS

If it's pleasing to look at, you're probably more likely to actually use it.

All settings can be found in `Settings > Appearence`

Take a look at the [[Theme Testing Page]] to see what you like and don't like!

## Theme

I use the Hipstersmoothie theme. 
I edited the colors of the theme, because when I used to keep the window translucent, I liked how it looked better with my background. Translucency is annoying though, so I just baked it all in (pictures and all). All that happens in the `hipster-fake-translucent` snippet.

## Custom CSS

I have four CSS snippets that I've made, `h-colors`, `prettier-lists`, `hipster-fake-translucent` (see above), and `oz-noselect`. 

`h-colors` makes headings different colors, and `prettier-lists` affects both the actual lists as well as the left-hand-side file browser. You can make edits to them in `Settings > Appearence > CSS snippets` (open containing folder), and check out your changes on the [[Theme Testing Page|testing page]]

`oz-noselect` might be outdated by now, because the developer noticed my snippet in the obsidian [discord](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm) and added it, but I'm not sure if that version has been sent out as I'm writing this. It just makes the Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin behave more nicely.
