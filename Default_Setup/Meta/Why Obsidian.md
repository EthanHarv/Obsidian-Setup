# Why I Use Obsidian

## Why?

For a long time, I kept notes in simple text files in vscode.

It was terrible.

I mean, don't get me wrongâ€”it worked.
I pretty much just used it as a place to write down what homework I had that day, and for that purpose it worked fine.

Eventually, though, I started to take notes during regular life: while I was coding, throwing stuff together, needed to remember something, etc.
I started feeling the limitations of simple text files.

No images! No formatting! No links!^[Well, you could just paste it, but it was clunky]

So, I ended up with [Notion](https://notion.so) for awhile, but that was slow and clunky and I didn't really like that all of my data was in this weird format that I had no access to.

Then I found obsidian!

It makes writing easy, linking even easier, all while wrapping it in fast, simple-to-use markdown files on my local disk. Along with the extensive theming support, plugins, and a large community, it just seemed obvious!
