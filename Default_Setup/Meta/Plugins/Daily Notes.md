# Daily Notes

[[Daily Notes]] is a basic plugin that does exactly what it saysâ€”it creates notes daily. (Thanks, Einstein)

All daily notes, once created, go into the `Daily` folder. They're named by `YYYY-MM-DD`, so alphabetical sort is also chronological sort. (This is configurable in settings)

## Creating

In my opinion, the easiest way to create a daily note is to open the [[Tricks, Keybinds, and Extras#Command Palette|Command Palette]], type in "`today`", and press enter.
This is pretty quick, and I would recommend it.

You can also use the Icon on the left-hand sidebar to create daily notes.

You could even make a keybind for it, but tbh the command palette way is more than easy enough for something you do once a day.

## Accessing

Obviously, you can open them like normal notes, but I'd recommend mainly referencing and opening them based off of the [[Calendar#Daily Notes Integration|Calendar]] and [[Natural Language Dates#Daily Notes Integration|Natural Language Dates]] plugins.
