# Obsidian Sync

Obsidian sync is a paid service that lets you easily sync your entire vault between devices. 

It's currently `$4/mo`, billed anually (`$48/yr`)

I use it because I like supporting the two-person dev team, and it just works well for me. (Plus it has E2E encryption!)

It also has version history, so if you lose stuff or something breaks, boom ez you have all your data still! (Though, independent backups are still a good idea.)

## Purchase

You can purchase sync from the [obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/sync).

## Folder Exclusions

You may notice the `_DesktopOnly` folder.
Once you connect to a vault, you can exclude this folder from sync, allowing you to have notes only stored on the computer they're made on.

## Alternatives

If you can't pay, take a look at [obsidian git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git).
