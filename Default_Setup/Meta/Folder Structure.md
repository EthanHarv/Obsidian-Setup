# Folder Structure

Honstly, it's all pretty straightforward.

Attachements go in `_Attachments`, templates go in `_Templates`, Daily notes go in `Daily`, etc.

Really, the only one to take note of is `_DesktopOnly`.
This is used in [[Sync]], and if you aren't using that you can delete it.

You can also delete all this meta stuff, it's all nicely contained in the `Meta` folder. (Except for the vscode image ![[vscode.png|100]], you can find that in `_Attachments`)
